## NIVA Fjord Model

General description of the model structure

The model is designed to be able to describe the eutrophication state of relatively closed fjords, especially fjords with basins separated from the open ocean by a sill. The practical aim is to evaluate the effect of treatment measures and other pollution reduction measures for fjords.

The model describes how dynamic biomass in the surface layer and the oxygen content in deeper layers of the fjord evolves during the year under various situations. The model is able to calculate changes in conditions as a function of:
- Inputs of nutrients (N, P, Si) and organic matter,
-	Changed distribution between surface discharge and dived discharge and
-	Changed distribution of discharge between the main basins of the fjord.

The model can also be used to describe how the relationships between various processes and components in the fjord change with changing physical conditions. Relevant examples are the forced circulation of deep water that can be introduced to a fjord by pumping down surface water, and the dredging of sill areas with possible altered vertical mixing in the fjord as the result.

The NIVA Fjord model is made up of several cooperative sub-models: biochemical models describe biological turnover in water and sediment, vertical particle transport, and exchange of solutes between water and sediment; a physical model describes vertical and horizontal water transport. The development of the conditions is the result of the interaction between these processes and influences from outside of the fjord system the model describes.
